# AI Project Practice

This repository is a curated collection of Python scripts and advanced AI projects that showcase my growth as an AI engineer. It includes basic practice programs written during my early learning journey and several comprehensive agentic AI and deep learning projects.

## Overview

- **Practice Python scripts (2019)**: A collection of small Python programs solving various algorithmic tasks.
- **Mega AI Projects** (`mega_ai_projects.zip` + `mega_ai_projects_report.md`): a bundle of end‑to‑end AI pipelines covering agentic AI, generative AI, LLMOps, AIOps, MLOps, and deep learning (ANN, CNN, RNN, LSTM, GRU). The accompanying report summarises objectives, prerequisites, tools, and detailed workflows.
- **Mind‑blowing AI Projects** (see the separate repository): features a GAN image generator, reinforcement learning agent and YOLO object detection model.

## How to Use

1. **Browse scripts**: Explore the `*.py` files in the root for basic algorithm practice.
2. **Download mega projects**: Click on `mega_ai_projects.zip` and `mega_ai_projects_report.md`. Download the zip, extract it locally and read the report for guidance on running each project.
3. **Check out mind‑blowing projects**: Visit the [`mindblowing_ai_projects`](https://github.com/Arjunkrshna/mindblowing_ai_projects) repository for cutting‑edge AI demos.
